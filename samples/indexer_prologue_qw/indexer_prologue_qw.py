"""Fused ``indexer_prologue_qw`` NPU kernel (CANNBotDSL, Ascend950 / dav-3510).

One MIX_AIC_1_2 kernel, two cube paths and one vector epilogue::

    C_w  BF16  x @ ww^T  --fixpipe(deq_scale=softmax_scale)-->  GM w
    C_q  MXFP8 qr @ wqb^T  =fixpipe(dual_dst)=>  cv_ub  --VF-->  GM q, descale_q

Tiling for the frozen case ``dim=5120, q_lora=1280, N=32, D=128, Dr=64``: the
``T`` axis is split over AICs in tiles of 128 rows, ``qr`` plus its MX scale
stay resident in L1 for the whole 32-head loop, ``wqb`` streams in 80 KB K
windows, and the W path's ``x`` traffic is chopped into 32 windows retired one
per head so it never stalls the cube.  The cube roofline at T=4096 is about 52.7 us vs HBM 38.7 us.

Everything the vector unit does is raw-VF register code.  ``vcast`` has no fp4
lowering in this wheel (verified), so E2M1 nibbles are produced by integer bit
manipulation and a small gather table, then packed two-per-byte.

# Read the public entry indexer_prologue_qw, then Plan, the main kernel, and

# Q is RoPE-quantised in UB and stored back to GM.  W either stores its result

    def _plan_head_split(self) -> None:
        """Split the head axis so the T-tiles alone do not have to fill the chip.

        Decode T is 1..192, which is one or two row tiles -- a T-only schedule
        would launch one or two cores and leave the other 30 idle, reporting the
        2-5% chip MFU the official small-T cases used to show.  The missing work
        is the other 31 heads, which are independent GEMMs, so the free axis for
        occupancy is N, not T.  Once the heads occupy the chip the shape is
        weight-load bound (``wqb`` is 5.24 MB whatever T is) and the target
        flips from MFU to MBU.

        Above ``cube_cores`` T-tiles the T axis fills the chip on its own and the
        head split is off: a core then owns a whole T-tile, keeps its ``qr`` in
        L1 for all 32 heads, and owns the W reduction outright.  That is the
        split-T template.  Measured at 28 cores and T=4096 the head split makes
        no difference at all there (157.6 .. 159.7 us over every block count from
        1 to 32, including the 4-cores-do-two-tiles imbalance), because the shape
        is MTE2-throughput bound and no split changes the bytes; so the cheapest
        schedule wins by default.

        Below that, more blocks is *not* simply better, and this is the one place
        where chasing occupancy actively costs time.  Splitting heads ``b`` ways
        launches ``b`` blocks, and every launched block pays a share of the
        the grid barrier and the band sum the workspace W reduction needs, while
        it only divides the per-core weight traffic.  Measured at 32 cores with
        the block count pinned (on the atomic-add reduction this replaced; the
        shape of the curve is what the score is fitted to, and the workspace
        reduction moved every column down by about the same 2 us):

            T     4 blk   8 blk   16 blk   32 blk
            1     16.20   11.10    9.58    12.02   us
            16    16.77   11.70   11.22    13.53
            72    20.57   14.80   13.83    15.88
            192   24.50   18.43   18.80    20.39

        so 16 launched blocks wins everywhere and 32 is 13-25% worse than that.
        Fitting those four columns to ``A + B*blocks + C*bytes_per_core`` gives
        B = 0.27 us per launched block against C = 1.8 us per head of weight
        traffic.  ``BLOCK_COST_HEADS`` is that B/C ratio: one launched block
        priced in head GEMMs.

        The other term is what a round costs beyond its head GEMMs: a core
        stages the T-tile's ``qr`` into L1 once per work item, so a round is
        ``base_m/d`` head GEMMs of weight traffic on top of ``heads_per_block`` of
        them (``qr`` is ``base_m`` rows of the same K extent that one head's
        ``wqb`` has ``d`` rows of).  Without that term the score prefers splits
        that shave a fraction off the round count and pay for it many times over
        in re-staged ``qr`` -- at 36 cores and T=2048 it would pick 32 blocks
        over 2, which measures 60.9 us against 54.3 us.

        With both terms the score reproduces the measured best block count at
        every (cores, T) pair that was swept: 28, 32 and 36 cores across
        T = 1, 16, 72, 192, 1024, 2048 and 4096.

        Lowering the per-block cost is the way to make finer splits pay.  The
        workspace reduction already took out the zero-fill and cut the barrier
        from four handshakes to two; ``BLOCK_COST_HEADS`` is still the fitted
        constant from before that, so it is now, if anything, pessimistic about
        fine splits.  Re-fit it if the reduction changes again.
